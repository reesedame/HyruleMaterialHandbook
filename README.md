# Hyrule Material Handbook

This app is an index of the gatherable materials featured in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With features like sorting and filtering, a user can easily determine what a material is and how to best locate it. All material information is collected using the [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/).
